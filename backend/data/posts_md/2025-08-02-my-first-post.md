And my mind is a blank… So much time spent into trying to perfect this website of mine, that I have no idea what do I write now. I literally RUSHED home from a meeting with friends, so **excited** to jot my thoughts down. HOW CAN I GO BLANK NOW?


I guess I could start with the reason with why I wanted to build this website. I want something that’s mine. Something that I tend to, and care for. A place I can go to, to experiment, and to add features, bit-by-bit. Sort of like a build-a-bear, haha. Funnily, this is exactly how React works, and how I have been framing my mind to think like such. Each component acts as a unique brick, and when you piece them together, you get a solid house! (Wow look at me applying React logic into everyday thinking). 

But it IS helpful though! I am currently working on building a dashboard with Streamlit for my current company. Applying the component logic, I do find myself writing code differently. I treat each element separately, on a separate file. I **try not** to have dependencies. I love that I’m thinking this way. Exiciting! 

OK- enough with the technical stuff. **Why** am I building this website. Well, I absolutely, and unapologetically LOVE to yap (and write), so it actually didn’t take much for me to want to build this. It’s like my tiny little corner on the internet, hoping someone enjoys my writing and thinkpieces (which speaking of, I also really want this smol blog to benefit/connect others together, through sharing of whatever wisdom I might have accumulated).

I actually used to have a blog (back in my angsty teenage days), but honestly owning your own little corner in digital land is so much more fun and exiciting. I’m really glad I am able to live and experience this, first hand!

But in all seriousness, I have also realized the benefits of keeping a journal/blog. The feelings I penned down in that moment of time, makes me realize how much I’ve grown (and also the other quirks I’ve kept). I always smile and laugh, reading about how troubled I was, and most importantly, how small my problems were, compared to the ones I have now. 

So this is me, trying to make a mark in this big world of ours, one component at a time.

Stay safe and Happy Coding!
