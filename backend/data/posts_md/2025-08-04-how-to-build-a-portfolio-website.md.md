Headsup! If you’re looking for code/blueprints to get you started, you can checkout my GitHub page! This post serves more as a dump to share my thought processes, and what I’ve learnt.

Hi friendos! It’s ya boy, Isaac, here to serve you hot, fresh, dumpster fire, which is what I would call my thought processes (it’s so hard to express one thought when I have like a gajillion of them whizzing around). 

Look, I wouldn’t call myself an “expert” at building websites or anything. In fact, I think in this day & age, I might be the furthest person from being an expert at building websites. However, building this thingamajig of a website **did** bring up a **heck ton** of challenges, which some of them took a few days to learn, understand, and lastly fix / build. I would want to document and share what I’ve learnt, so that in an event where Google’s SEO picks up my website, shows it to you, and you’re (hopefully) feeling inspired to do something of your own, may this post act as a guiding light for how to even get started. 

# What are you building?

A portfolio. That’s cool! A portfolio that does what, though? Showcase your projects and skills. Got it. But Why? Cause I’m forgetful and would want to have a place where I can go to for reference to my work + I get to learn a new skill! 

This was what went through my head when the idea of building my own website was still fresh. After browsing through talented developer’s like Alvin, Brittany and Kane, I challenged myself to do the same, not only because was I seriously impressed with their work, but also because it felt like it was **fun** (and yes, fun is arguably one of the most important factor in driving you to complete a project, if building a website is not your thing, that’s **perfectly OK**).

So, my dear friend, you *want* to build a website. But **what**?

# Start with the basics

Congrats! You’ve figured out what you

# Just. Put. It. Out. There.

And I can’t stress this enough. JUST PUT IT OUT THERE. Commit and merge that branch that is full of broken links, margin errors, and un-centered divs. The point is to 

Halfway through, I realized my website was… quite ugly. `<div>` were all over the place. Margins and paddings were a mess. *Wait why did I write this again?* So many questions. 

# Realize that the wheel has already been invented

It is every beginner’s rite-of-passage, to ask the age-old question. 

*“Girl, surely there has to be a better way to do this”* 

And fortunately for us, there is! Actually writing HTML and CSS was starting to get 

This moment is pivotal, as it made me understand why people used React, or other libraries to make their lives easier. It suddenly became clear that these are not “scary” and “intimidating” tools used to confuse me. Rather, tools that brilliant people came up with to make their lives easier, and kindly shared it with the rest of the digital world. 

# Obsess over your creation

# Discover some things you would like to add

1. What are you building? 
2. Narrow it down 
3. Start with the basics
4. Just. Put. It. Out. There.

8. Repeat

“oh, i realized i dont want to always hit the api cause it’s costing me $. can i just store it in browser? yes! that’s actually the cache!” 

you dont just become an expert because of. it’s through frustration, and doing it repeatedly, where your brain’s neurons can activated over and over again, until it. just. makes. sense.
