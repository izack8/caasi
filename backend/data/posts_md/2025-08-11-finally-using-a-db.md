I've put this writing off for some time, partly because I want to be able to form coherent paragraphs before jotting it down. But the more I delay, the more I forget (urGH, frustrating). So here's my feeble attempt in trying to describe my journey in integrating MongoDB into my website by stringing a couple of words together. 

# I'll change this title later
Prior to what it is now, my data (experiences, projects, and also posts) were stored in JSON files (as an array of JSON objects). At the beginning of this website, I knew very little about hosting a database, and how to retrieve it conventionally. The way that makes sense the **most** for me (at that time), was just using a JSON file to store. (If you go back to the first iteration of my website, you are able to see my thought processes)

# I think I need to add more points 
OK it's 12:17AM now, I'm tired, I need to sleep. I will come back to this later. sljfsljkdfaslj
