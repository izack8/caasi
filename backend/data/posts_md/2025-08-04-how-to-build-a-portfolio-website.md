Hi friendos! It‚Äôs ya boy, Isaac, here to serve you hot, fresh, dumpster fire, which is what I would call my thought processes (it‚Äôs so hard to express one thought when I have like a gajillion of them whizzing around). 

Look, I wouldn‚Äôt call myself an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù at building websites or anything. In fact, I think in this day & age, I might be the furthest person from being an expert at building websites. However, building this thingamajig of a website **did** bring up a **heck ton** of challenges, which some of them took a few days to learn, understand, and lastly fix / build. I would want to document and share what I‚Äôve learnt, so that in an event where Google‚Äôs SEO picks up my website, shows it to you, and you‚Äôre (hopefully) feeling inspired to do something of your own, may this post act as a guiding light for how to even get started. 

# What are you building?

*A portfolio. That‚Äôs cool! A portfolio that does what, though? Showcase your projects and skills. Got it. But Why? Cause I‚Äôm forgetful and would want to have a place where I can go to for reference to my work + I get to learn a new skill!*

This was what went through my head when the idea of building my own website was still fresh. After browsing through talented developer‚Äôs like Alvin, Brittany and Kane, I challenged myself to do the same, not only because was I seriously impressed with their work, but also because it felt like it was **fun** (and yes, fun is arguably one of the most important factor in driving you to complete a project, if building a website is not your thing, that‚Äôs **perfectly OK**).

So, my dear friend, you *want* to build a website. But **what**?

# Start with the basics

Congrats! You‚Äôve figured out what you want to build! You got your north star! 

*Yay! Let's start using the **most** advanced tools, because I want to **keep up with the times**, and know modern code. I want to stay relevant!*

And you're absolutely valid! **But**, in my case, starting with the basics truly laid down a solid foundation for deeper learning. I start to understand **how and why** things are done a certain way. Most importantly, you understand the **frustrations** and **problems** that arises when using a basic building block, and I promise you, the more you progress, the more you understand why certain things *just makes sense*.

I really liked how senior developer, theprimeagen put it. He drew a curve of knowledge vs. time. The curve for starting high in knowledge in a short time is usually inversely proportionate to each other, where as starting at a lower point in knowledge simply makes the curve grow exponentially overtime, because you had a solid foundational knowledge to understand intricate complexities. 

One example was during my research, I was faced with having to choose between Next.js and normal React  (Mind you, I didn't even know how React worked). Everyone in the forums just seemed like they were spewing slangs and nonsensical abbreviations. SSR? SPA? **What are these???** Yet, it seemed like all developers were choosing Next.js. I **did feel** left out and clueless. *Should I just start with Next.js?*.

The more I progressed with the building of this website, the more I understood. *Ah! **S**ingle-**P**age **A**pplications, like my React app now. I only have one home page (+ a blog). I don't need **S**erver-**S**ide **R**endering, because I don't care for SEO + it will be resource intensive ($$$).*

So, no! Turns out I didn't need Next.js (but maybe in the future!).

# Just. Put. It. Out. There.

And omg, I can‚Äôt stress this enough. **JUST PUT IT OUT THERE**. Commit,  merge that branch that is full of broken links, misaligned paddings, and un-centered divs. Learn about deployment, pay for their credits, and deploy. Just. Put. It. out. You can perfect it **later**. 

Too many times, I caught myself wondering *hmm, maybe I should not put this here? What about this? No...*. Did I learn anything from it? NO. It's only through actually visualizing, using and again, frustration, where you would eventually know what works best for **you**. 

Additionally, it helped me feel a sense of **accountability** and **urgency**. *Do I really want someone to view this website in that state? Do I want to continue paying to showcase a web like that?*

# Realize that the wheel has already been invented

It is every beginner‚Äôs rite-of-passage, to ask the age-old question. 

*‚ÄúGirl, surely there has to be a better way to do this‚Äù* 

And fortunately for us, there is! Now if you are a newbie to webdev like me, you probably would have started with HTML and CSS for web design. *Ain't it an absolute **pain** to write its' code?*

Writing HTML and CSS *was* starting to get tedious and 

This moment is pivotal, as it made me understand why people used React, or other libraries to make their lives easier. It suddenly became clear that these are not ‚Äúscary‚Äù and ‚Äúintimidating‚Äù tools used to confuse me. Rather, tools that brilliant people came up with to make their lives easier, and kindly shared it with the rest of the digital world.

‚Äúoh, i realized i dont want to always hit the api cause it‚Äôs costing me $. can i just store it in browser? yes! that‚Äôs actually the cache!‚Äù 

you dont just become an expert because of. it‚Äôs through frustration, and doing it repeatedly, where your brain‚Äôs neurons can activated over and over again, until it. just. makes. sense.
