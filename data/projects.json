I feel like this process helps me understand why certain things are done in a certain way, which I feel is the best way to learn anything‚úîÔ∏è.",

            "And on-top of this, I also learned the smaller things where people usually miss, like how important the file structure in the project folder and in JSON files etc. Like I need to write and organize them to meet my needs, and not just copy-paste from the internet.",

Context for non-NTU students, we have a frigging painful system for customizing our time-tables + modules selection every semester. It's basically fastest fingers first, BUT the system crashes every time, or your internet lags behind or something. It's a MESS.",
            "So once you get into the system, you have to get to the module selection page, and then you have to click module, and then you have to click through like 5654984 more buttons to confirm the selection. And then you have to do this for every module you want to select.",
            "Anyways, I got fed up with the tireless clicking (cause it's literally the same buttons you have to click every time), so I decided to automate it, and let it run in the background while I do OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS.",
