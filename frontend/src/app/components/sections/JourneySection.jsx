                My journey in software development started when I was in Polytechnic, where I learned how to build mobile applications. Following that, I pursued a degree in Electrical Enginnering in University, because I wanted to learn more about how hardware and software interacts with each other (she's got the beeeeest, of both worldssssss).

                Welp, unfortunately, that didn't go so well (circuitry was so challenging to learn, imo), so for the last 2 years in Uni, I decided to shift my focus back to programming, which is where I also discovered <b>Data Science,</b> <b>AI & Machine Learning</b>. I was so fascinated by how AI can be used to solve real-world problems, and I wanted to learn more about it (Like the entire concept of <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b> ARE SO COOL WTH).
