            <p>I have an idea to show the thought processes of my journey building this website. I want to highlight the challenges I faced, the solutions I found, and the lessons I learned along the way.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Cause this website building thing started in Feb 2025, and boyyy, did i LEARN SO MUCH (cause it literally did not use to look like this). This iteration is done using <b>React</b> and <b>Tailwind CSS</b>. Omg my life got so much better after using Tailwind CSS LOL.</p>
