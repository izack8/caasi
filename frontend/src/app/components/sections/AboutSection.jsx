        If you don't find me writing code, you can find me playing the guitar (or learning a new musical instrument) and making covers of songs made by the <b>greatest songwriter of this century, Ms. Taylor Alison Swift.</b> (Bonus points if you can find my YouTube channel, I have a few covers there (I'd like to think I sing pretty well, hehe))
