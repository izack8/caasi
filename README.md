# izack.dev

Welcome to izack.dev, my personal website where I showcase my projects, skills, and experiences as a Data Scientist and Software Engineer. 

I'm trying to learn how to build a web app, first, starting with the basics (html + css), and then moving on to more frameworks and libs as I learn more. 

First iteration: v1.izack.dev; github.com/izack8/caasi_v1
